## Introduction

This project began as a list of functions for tasks I did repeatedly and hated coding every new instance. Now, it has evolved into a statistical utility tool and a notepad. Some of these functions were created because I wanted to learn and understand the innards of some mathematical concept, and are thus not optimized in any way. Other functions have been used repeatedly on projects and are hopefully optimized to some extent.

Some of the more useful code here extends functionality of sklearn and other libraries. The more useful things will be highlighted in this README.

Also, I apologize for the poorly documented code at the moment, please forgive me :) It will get better soon, I promise!

## Installation

Note: as of this posting, the package may not be quite ready for pip/conda. But fear not, it will be soon...

To Install:

I haven't created a conda build of this package yet, but for when I do:

```{python}
conda install tsdst
```
