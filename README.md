# Tom's Statistics and Data Science Toolkit (tsdst)

## Introduction

This project began as a list of functions for tasks I did repeatedly and hated coding every new instance. Now, it has evolved into a statistical utility tool and a notepad. Some of these functions were created because I wanted to learn and understand the innards of some mathematical concept, and are thus not optimized in any way. Other functions have been used repeatedly on projects and are hopefully optimized to some extent.

## Installation

Note: as of this posting, the package may not be quite ready for pip/conda. But fear not, it will be soon...
